Change State methods to follow callback conventions.
Exmaple:
	enter -> onEnter
	leave -> onLeave
	destroy -> onDestroy
	
//Change direct references to parent with self.class.super
//Important: Cannot be used in `initialize`
Yeah, don't do that. Causes tons of stack overflows.
Doesn't handle inheritance properly.

change Fsm `add` to `addState` but then how would scenes work? just say addState?
Wrap it behind a addScene?

Scene shouldn't include the GAME:getEventSystem.... thingy when added.

evsys:attach(obj, Event) doesn't work
	Using Event says must be Event or subclass of it
	Using EvSomething says isSubc
